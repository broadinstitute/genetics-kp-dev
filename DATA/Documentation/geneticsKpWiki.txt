# Description

We developed the Genetics Knowledge Provider (KP), a knowledge-centric data provider for computation based genetic association results, 
as part of the NCATS Biomedical Data Translator (“Translator”). The Genetics KP aims to 
* integrate Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data sources in an unbiased way, and 
* provide a curated, unified framework for genetic associations to deepen our understanding of gene/disease biology. 

The Genetics KP takes advantage of broad access to disease specific GWAS datasets, portals, and computational tools, 
to integrate information available for diseases and their associated genes, including similarity-based connections. We follow a stringent 
procedure to avoid expert bias, including data scouting and recording data provenance, to create a unified framework for gene/disease associations. 

We bring to the Translator project computational genetics expertise, and using signal aggregating algorithms and tools to combine genetic signals across GWAS studies.
